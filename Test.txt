1.Java is a programming language.
high speed prgm lang
  javac and java are used for compilation,they are the 
  tools in jdk,which is used for execution.

2.JDK-Java Development Kit :Its is used for execution and writing the code.
      Tools + jre

  JRE- Java RunTime Environment : its is used for execution.
       it consists of pre-defined library 
       Library + jvm

  JVM-Java virtual machine : it is used for execution perpose,
      used to convert source code to byte code. 
      (.byte code to source code)  
      
3. .Java-file : It is a java extention,which is used to store the file in that perticular file.

 .class file : it is a copy of the .java file which has the extention of .class, it is for the acces.

4. IDE's : Appache,eclips,xcodeid

5.Variable :
  Variable is a container which stores the values or the info.
  Variable can be accesed.
  Variable cannot act as the keyWord.
  There are two types in variable they are
 1.Class variable:  
Static variable and non-Static variable.
  Static variable can be declare with the key word static.
  Non-Static variable is declare directly without the key word static.
 It can be declared in 4 ways
   1.Constructor
   2.method
   3.ref
   4.Literals
2.Method level
 static level
 parameter

Constructor: it is a special method,which has no return type.
             the class name is same as the constructor name.
             it is called with the new keyword.
Methods: methods is a set of statements.which is invoked whenever it is in need.

reference : reference is a address of the perticular info, which is stored in a constant pool.

Literals : literals are nothing but the init.
          ex: char size='M'.
          

6. Object oriented programming in java is basically is of 4 principles,
   1.Polymorphism
   2.abstraction
   3.inheritance
   4.encapslution

  polymorphism: One statement in many forms is the simple defination of the polymorphism.
  Abstration : hiding the inner details or the code and showing the functionality.
  Inheritance : The extration of class and behivor from the parent class to the sub class.
  Encapslution : wrapping of the codes is called encapslution.

7. output will be error because method is overloaded.


8. Data type are the pre defined values, which has its own primitive.
data types are of two types 
primitive data type and non-primitive data types.
   
There are 8 pre defined data type      non-primitive

   int                                   String,array,class
                                         any name 
   float
   long                                   
   double        
   byte
  short
  boolean
  char

non primitive data type can be string or anything that we declare as the data type
string="Ambrutha"
Computer computer

9. Dot operator: dot operator is used to access the variables and the methods of the class.

   class Machine
{
   String type;
   String name;
}
static void machine{
    System.out.println("operating system");
}

here system:non access specifier
     out: is a variable
     println:method name.



10.java features:Java is designed by Jemes golling in 1991.
   Java features,
   1.high speed
   2.secure
   3.Java is used in many accessories like ac,moblile,and other equipments.
   4.easy to learn and access.
   5.Robust.
   

11.Array: Array is collection of similar objects which is stored in a sequence.
         example:
         logo[]={1,2,3,4,5}

12.Class: Class is a template.it is non access speci
         example:

class Choco
{
String type;
String name;
double price;
}
static void main(String[] args)
{
//codes
}

Object: objects are the instance of the class.
 they are the real world entity.



13.Keywords:Keywords are the pre defined words or the reserved words.
            they have there own properties. 
there are 48 key words.
1.new
2.this
3.package
4.is
5.continue*
6.goto*
7.final
8.finally
9.if
10.return


14.Constructor:Constructor is a special method.
Constructor name is same as that of the class name.
It is used to invoke the instance of the variable.

Default constructor:
Parametarized constructor:

15.Main method is static because jvm can be called without the instance variable or class.

  Method types:
  there are two type:
Static  and non-satic 
Static method can be called single time.
used with a static keyword
non-static method can be called multiple time.

ex:
class name
{
void ex()
{

}
}

ex:
class name
{
static void name()
{

}
}



16.Class Example{

input[]={12,3,2,45,6,7,6};
Example input[]
for(i=input ;length>7;i++)
{
System.out.println("the length of the arrary is:");
}


17.method : methods is a set of statements or block of codes which is used to access in a class.
 method can b called by passing the method name and other way is calling the method with the parameter.

method overloading : When a class have multiple methods by same name but different parameters known as method overloading.

class Addition
{  
static int add( a, b) 
static int add( a, b, c) 
}  
class AdditionOver
{  
public static void main(String[] args)
{  
System.out.println(Addition.add(1,2));  
System.out.println(Addition.add(11,12,13));  
} 
}
